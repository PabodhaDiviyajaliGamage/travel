    title: "Sigiriya - The Lion Rock Fortress",
    description:
      "Sigiriya, often called the Lion Rock Fortress, is one of Sri Lanka’s most spectacular and historically significant landmarks. Rising nearly 200 meters above the surrounding plains in the heart of the island, this ancient rock fortress was built in the 5th century AD by King Kashyapa I as a royal palace and stronghold. The site is renowned for its remarkable combination of natural beauty and human creativity, featuring intricately designed water gardens, frescoes of celestial maidens, and the famous Mirror Wall covered with ancient graffiti. Halfway up the rock, visitors can see the colossal lion’s paws that once formed the grand entrance to the summit palace, giving Sigiriya its name—derived from “Sinhagiri,” meaning “Lion Rock.”",
